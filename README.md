# Data Structures and Algorithms Practice

This repository is dedicated to solving Data Structures and Algorithms
(DSA) problems, mainly inspired by LeetCode-style questions. The goal is
to strengthen problem-solving skills, improve coding efficiency, and
prepare for technical interviews.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Purpose

-   Practice and master core DSA concepts
-   Improve problem-solving patterns such as two pointers, sliding
    window, recursion, and dynamic programming
-   Maintain a clean and well-documented collection of solutions
-   Track personal growth and consistency over time

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Topics Covered

This repository will gradually cover:

-   Arrays and Strings
-   Hash Maps and Sets
-   Two Pointers and Sliding Window
-   Stacks and Queues
-   Linked Lists
-   Trees and Binary Search Trees
-   Heaps and Priority Queues
-   Recursion and Backtracking
-   Greedy Algorithms
-   Dynamic Programming
-   Graphs (BFS, DFS, shortest paths)
-   Bit Manipulation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Solution Format

Each solution generally includes:

-   Problem description
-   Approach or intuition
-   Time complexity
-   Space complexity
-   Clean and readable code

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Languages Used

Solutions may be written in:

-   TypeScript / JavaScript
-   Python
-   Java (optional)

The primary language may evolve based on focus.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Progress Tracking

-   Problems are solved consistently
-   Difficulty levels range from Easy to Medium to Hard
-   Emphasis is placed on understanding patterns rather than
    memorization

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Contributions

This is primarily a personal learning repository. However, suggestions,
optimized approaches, and alternative solutions are welcome.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Resources

-   LeetCode
-   NeetCode
-   GeeksforGeeks
-   Cracking the Coding Interview

## Motivation

Consistency is more important than intensity.
The aim is not just to solve problems, but to think better as an
engineer.
